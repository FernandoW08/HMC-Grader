To run this site you must create a python virtual env for testing. This has to have the following packages installed:

 * flask
 * flask-script
 * flask-bootstrap
 * flask-login
 * flask-markdown
 * mongoengine
 * flask-mongoengine
 * WTForms
 * python-dateutil
 * pygments
 * celery
 * psutil
 * netifaces
 * pexpect
 * gevent

The site can then be run with the command:

`<virtualenv>/bin/python run.py`
